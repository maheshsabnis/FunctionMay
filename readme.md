# Azure Serverless Principal
- Azure Functions
	- Azure Based Serverless Object Model
	- .NET 6 Runtime
		- Use dotnet.exe to load the function code and execute
	- .NET 6, 7 and V4 Isolated Process
		- Use an isolated dedictaed Process to execute the function
- .NET 6 Runtime
	- Mirosoft.NET.Sdk.Functions
		- An object model that has
			- All Triggers
			- Execution
			- Resource Management
				- Dependencies
	- FunctionNameAttribute class
		- The class taht is applied on the method to set behavior to that method as a function method
			- function method, is the method that will be invoked inside the runtime based on Trigger
	- local.settings.json
		- Configuration file for local execution
		- This will contains
			- Connection String to Storage
			- Any other configuration values which we cannot /  should not store in code
	- host.json
		- This will nbe usd by Azure DeploymentEnvironment
		- Same as local.settings.json for Azure deployment
- For deploying on Azure follow steps as mentioned below
	- MUST have Azure Subscription
		- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
	- Create a resource group
		- A Logical Container (Like Folder) where all the Azure Resources e.g. Storage, VM, API App, Databse etc. are stored
	- We can create an Azure Function using Azure Portla inside the resource group
	- Selecting Deployment Plan for Azure Function
		- Consumption (Serverless)
			- Optimized for serverless and event-driven workloads.  	
				- CPU, RAM and other resource will be allocated only when the trigger is fired
		- Functions Premium
			- Event based scaling and network isolation, ideal for workloads running continuously.  
			- e.g.
				- Process of large Datasets
		- App service plan
			- Fully isolated and dedicated environment suitable for workloads that need large SKUs or need to co-locate Web Apps and Functions.
			- Use Azure function as a Full Implementation of the API Apps
- HttpTriggers
- BLOBTriggers
- Durable Functions
	- Chain
	- FanOut/FanIn
	- Monitor
- Security
- Deplopyment
- Logic Apps
- Availability
